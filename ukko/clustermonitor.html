<h1>Ukko Cluster Monitor</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This code snippet can be used to monitor the Ukko cluster in the Department of Computer Science, 
University of Helsinki. Ukko cluster is a fundamental high performance computing facility shared by all
the researchers and students in the CS department. Every day, there are various experiments and tasks 
performed on Ukko.
</p>

<p>
This lightweight monitor can provide you with basic realtime stats of Ukko cluster. The software uses about
60KiB/s of your bandwidth.
</p>


<h2>How to run it?</h2>

<p>
Make sure you run it within our department network, or you cannot receive any state updates of the
nodes. What's more, make sure you have wxPython installed on you machine. If you run the application
on Melkki or on the department workstations, then you needn't worry about this issue since the wxPython
has already been installed.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, it is recommended that you run the application on a machine with large display. Since
the application will detect the size of the display area, if the display area is too small, some stats
will be hidden and only summary information will be shown. So, please maximize the application when you
run it, :)
</p>

<p>
Download the <a href="monitor.py">Monitor</a>, run <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;"> python monitor.py </span>,
then enjoy! :)
